## Features

The table can be live-searched by all fields. With more data, we might
need to push some of this logic server-side, but with ~100 records,
searching client-side is nice and snappy!

Selecting a record in the table populates a baseball-card style info
panel in the header region.

## TODO

- [ ] pagination
- [ ] sort on columns
